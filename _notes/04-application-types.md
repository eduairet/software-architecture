# Application Types

- The type of application is defined after the requirements are set
- Types of applications:
  - **Web Application:**
    - The most common type of application after APIs
    - They are the way the internet worked since its inception
    - They're hosted on one or more servers and accessed via a web browser
    - They communicate with the server using HTTP
    - They use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render the UI
    - It's best suited for applications that need an UI, user initiated events, large scale, and short/focused actions within a request-response cycle
  - **Web API (Application Programming Interface):**
    - It serves data to other applications
    - Its client is not a web browser but another application
    - The most popular type of API is REST which means Representational State Transfer and is based on HTTP
      - It uses URLs to identify resources, parameters to filter data, and HTTP methods to perform actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
    - It's best suited for applications that need data retrieval and storage, client initiated actions, large scale, and short/focused actions within a request-response cycle
  - **Mobile Application:**
    - It runs on mobile devices
    - They work well with Web APIs
    - They're best suited for user interaction, offline access, front-end for a Web API, location-based services, and push notifications
  - **Console Application:**
    - It runs in a terminal or command line interface so it doesn't have a graphical user interface
    - They require technical knowledge to be used
    - They can run long or short processes
    - It's best suited for applications that need to run in the background, perform batch processing, and have no user interaction
  - **Services**
    - They are like console applications but they run in the background and are not started by the user
    - They're managed by the service manager
    - They're best suited for long-running processes, background tasks, and scheduled tasks
  - **Desktop Application:**
    - It has all of its resources on the local machine (including logic, data, and UI)
    - It might or not have a network connection
    - They usually need a great UI
    - They're best suited for user centric actions (like word processing), gaming
- Even though we covered different types of applications, it's important to recall that there are other types of applications, like functions as a service (lambda)
- It's important to define these early
- A project can have only one or several types
