# External Considerations

- These considerations are not directly related to the architecture of the system, but they can have a significant impact on the success of the project.

##Â Deadlines

- This is a common constraint in software development projects and can be a major factor in the success or failure of a project.
- Deadlines can vary widely depending on the project and the organization this is why we need to have a good understanding of the project requirements and what we need to do to meet them.
- To have a more accurate estimate of the time we'll need to consider:
  - The development team's experience and skill level.
  - The complexity of implementing the architecture, it's not the same a queue system than a payment system.

## Developers' Skills

- Unknown technologies can lead to delays and increased costs, besides of low quality code.
- Sometimes if the languages are similar the unknown technology can be feasible to use, for example:
  - If the team is familiar with Java, they may be able to pick up Kotlin relatively quickly.
  - If the team is familiar with JavaScript and Node.js it might be a bad idea to use Rust for the backend.

## IT Support

- When recommending products like databases, queue engines, etc. we need to consider the support that the IT team can provide.
- A developer is there to develop, not to be a sysadmin.
- Even though at first the developers can be excited about using a new technology and set it up, they won't be happy when the excitement wears off and they have to deal with the maintenance of that technology.

## Cost

- Sometimes there are products that solve a problem but are too expensive for the project, so it's important to analyze the cost of the product vs the cost of developing a solution in-house, like dashboards, monitoring, etc.
- Even though the rule of thumb is to always use an existing solution, we need to consider our resources and the cost of the solution.
