# Introduction

- There are different types of technology architects
  - Infrastructure architect
    - They design the infrastructure of the system
    - They are familiar with the requirements of the system
    - The career path of an infrastructure architect is usually an infrastructure expert
  - Software architect
    - They design the software of the system, we'll be focusing on this
  - Enterprise architect
    - They work with the top level management of the company
    - They streamline the IT to support the business
    - They don't have development-oriented tasks
    - The career path of an enterprise architect is usually a senior software analyst or a project manager

## Software Architect

- The main difference between a software architect and a software engineer is that the architect knows what should be done and the engineer knows what can be done
- Their main objective is to accomplish a fast, secure, reliable, and maintainable system, selecting the best technologies and tools to achieve that
- In the organization chart, the software architect should not have management tasks like a project manager, but they should be able to lead the team

### Why an Architect Should Code?

- The architect should be able to code to understand the limitations of the technology and the team
  - For example, when deciding which database to use, the architect should be able to code the database access layer and compare the performance of the different databases to decide which one is the best for the system
- He should support the team in the development of the system
- Gain respect and trust from the developers

### The Architect's Mindset

- Understand the business
  - You have to have a deep understanding of the business to be able to design the system
  - Understand the weaknesses and strengths, the competitors, the growth strategy
- Define the system goals
  - Understand that goals are not the same as requirements
  - The goals describe the effect of the system on the business
  - These are usually described by the client, the stakeholders, or the management tema, but there are exceptions
    ```
    System: A marketplace for selling and buying used cars
    Organization: A car dealer
    Goals:
      - Increase the number of cars sold
      - Increase the number of cars bought
      - Make the process of selling and buying cars easier (appointments, payments, etc.)
      ...
    ```
- Your client's clients
  - The end users of the system is not the client, but the client's clients so we need to understand their needs
  - Sometimes the client doesn't know what their clients need, so we need to understand the business in order to propose backed up solutions
- Use the right language
  - Try to communicate the thing that really matters to the person you're talking to
    - For example, if you're talking to a developer, you can use technical terms, but if you're talking to a manager, you should use business terms
