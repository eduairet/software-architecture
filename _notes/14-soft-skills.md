- Some of the most relevant soft skills include:

    - Don't be afraid to change your mind if the evidence supports it or give it a second thought.
  - **Be Smart not Right:** Don't try to be right all the time, instead focus on being smart and making the best decision for the team and the project.
    - If you are wrong, admit it and move on.
    - If you are right, don't gloat about it, instead find a way to get the team to agree with you, like offering a talk to discuss the topic and share your knowledge.
