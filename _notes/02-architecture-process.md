# The Architecture Process

## Understand the System's Requirements

- Requirements are the foundation of the system and define what the system should do
- These are set after the goals are defined
- These are usually defined by the system analyst

## Understand the Non-Functional Requirements

- They define the technical and service level attributes of the system (user loads, volumes, performance, etc.)
- These are not commonly known by the client or analyst
- These are very crucial for the system because they can make the difference between a successful and a failed system

## Map the Components

- They represent the tasks of the system
- Their goals are:
  - Understand the system's functionality
  - Communicate the understanding to the client
- This part i not technical

## Select the Technology Stack

- Usually select the backend, frontend, and data store technologies
- A successful technology stack depends on the system's requirements but also on the team's skills
- The architect should be able to code the system to understand the limitations of the technology and the team

##Â Design the Architecture

- The architect should be able to design the architecture of the system based on the requirements and the technology stack
- A good architecture as we mentioned, should be fast, secure, reliable, and maintainable

## Write the Architecture Document

- This document provides a high-level overview of the system and its components for the client and the team
- It should be relevant for all the parties involved in the system

## Support the Team

- Even though the architecture is settled in the document, this doesn't mean it's not going to change, in fact, it will change a lot so the architect should support the team in the process deciding these changes

## Conclusion

- It's important to highlight that the process can be iterative, and the people involved in every step of the process can change depending on the system, goals, and requirements
- When designing the architecture is very important to have developers involved in the process to understand the limitations of the technology and the team, this will prevent the architect from designing a system that is impossible to build
